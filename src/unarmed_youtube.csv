zHKPRo02JIc,20191226,Video shows Florida deputies shoot and kill armed man | 10News WTSP,"A domestic violence situation turned deadly on Christmas Eve in Volusia County.

Authorities say it began when a woman called a relative to say her brother was being irrational and abusive. And, he was armed.

The call came from a house on Gaucho Circle in a normally-quiet Deltona neighborhood. The woman was visiting her 65-year-old brother, Harvey Cantrell, after the recent death of their mother.

Volusia County deputies were dispatched and set up a perimeter while trying to get the sister out of the house.

Just before 9 p.m., authorities say she came to the front door, followed closely by Cantrell. Deputies say he shot at her -- hitting her in the shoulder and face. At that moment, deputies say they fired back, killing him.

The sister was taken to Central Florida Hospital in Sanford, where deputies said she was stable. Sheriff Mike Chitwood credits the deputies with acting quickly to save her life.

As per standard protocol, the deputies who fired their service weapons have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

Editor's Note: If you are affected by domestic violence, there is help. Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.

Grewal identified the Jersey City attackers as 47-year-old David N. Anderson and 50-year-old Francine Graham.

Both were found dead at the scene of the attack at a kosher market Tuesday in Jersey City, along with three civilian victims. Authorities say Detective Joseph Seals was killed earlier near a cemetery about a mile away.

Anderson and Graham, clearly targeted the place, the Jersey City mayor said Wednesday, amid growing fears the bloodshed was an anti-Semitic attack.

Authorities are investigating potential connections between the attackers and the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, some of whose members are known to rail against whites and Jews, a law enforcement official familiar with the case told the Associated Press.

Investigators also are scouring social media postings of at least one of the gunmen in search of a motive, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still going on.

The Evansville Police Department released Body cam footage, Dash Cam of one of their officer involved in a fatal shooting responding to a crash occurred on October 28, 2019.

The video also include police chief press briefing.

Police chief statement: ""Unfortunately, a news story posted online quoted a single witness who gave a version that has been debunked by multiple other witnesses and body cam footage. The story was posted several minutes before schedule EPD press conference where the below details were released. The narrative included in the news story was addressed in our press conference and was characterized as false.

Man Armed With Hammer Shot by Officer—

On Monday, October 28, 2019 at 6:28 p.m., an EPD Officer was dispatched to what many would consider a routine call for service – a response to a traffic collision.

A witness to the crash stopped to see if they could render assistance to the driver involved in the collision.

Within two minutes, an officer arrived and was met by the original witness to the crash as well as two other witnesses. One of the witnesses told our officer that he believed that the driver of the vehicle appeared to be under the influence of some substance.

Our officer approached the wrecked vehicle and found the driver, who has been identified as 45 year-old Terry Wayne Chanley.

Chanley was sitting in the vehicle with his door open and appeared to be intoxicated by his appearance and mannerisms.

Our officer asked Chanley for his driver`s license and registration and he just shook his head and began reaching underneath his seat

Chanley was given verbal commands to stop reaching for items, which he ignored. Because Chanley continued to reach for items in a suspicious manner disregarding the officer’s orders, the officer backed away in order to give him some distance from Chanley and drew his weapon.

The officer continued to shout commands, telling Chanley to show his hands. Chanley then grabbed an object appeared to be black, pointed it at the officer and began to move toward him in an aggressive manner.

At this point, our officer believing that Chanley was armed with a gun and posed an immediate threat to himself and the witnesses that were behind the officer fired his handgun at Chanley.

Our officer began to back away from Chanley while still issuing commands and Chanley continued to advance on the officer in an aggressive manner. Fearing for his own safety and the safety of the witnesses, our officer fired at Chanley again.

Chanley still continued to advance on the officer fired a third and final time in order to stop the immediate threat to his life.
The EPD believes that our officer acted and performed his duties in a legal, justified, and reasonable manner, taking action to protect members of the public as well as himself from serious injury or harm

I understand that due to the nature of this case and the amount of attention that it has garnered, there is more information that people want to know.

Please understand that this investigation is still fluid and evolving and that we will share additional information as long as it does not compromise the investigation.""

iVYhP22Yqb4,20190906,New Details Released in Brooklyn Center Officer-Involved Shooting,"The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has released new details on the officer-involved shooting in Brooklyn Center that resulted in the death of a 21-year-old man.

Brooklyn Center police were called to a home Saturday, Aug. 31, on a report of a man threatening his grandparents with a hammer and a knife. According to the BCA, officers tried to physically subdue the man, identified as Kobe Dimock-Heisler. They then deployed Tasers, but to no avail. The BCA said Dimock-Heisler threatened the officers with a knife. That’s when two officers discharged their firearms, the agency said.

The BCA identified the three officers who discharged their weapons as:     Brandon Akers, who has been with the Brooklyn Center Police Department for eight years. Officer Akers discharged his Taser and his firearm.     Steven Holt, a Brooklyn Center police officer for five years, discharged his Taser.     Cody Turner, a 10-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center Police Department. Officer Turner discharged his Taser and his firearm.

Turner allowed CCX News to ride along with him last year to show us how police try to build trust and interact with the community.

Man Battled Mental Health Problems
A Star Tribune report says Dimock-Heisler battled severe depression, citing a mental health court order. The mental health order showed he had a history of threatening suicide. It stated how he posed “a substantial likelihood of causing physical harm.”

The BCA’s investigation is still ongoing, but it did say all the officers involved were wearing body cameras, capturing video of the incident.

OGMD8518AkI,20190730,"Outrage Grows after Bodycam Shows NJ Officer Shoot, Kill Dog That Charged at Him | NBC New York","A New Jersey police officer is seen on bodycam footage shooting a dog that charged at him while on the street.

Officer Emanuel Rivera was on Tall Oaks Drive Saturday afternoon after someone in Vernon Township called the police about an aggressive dog on the loose. The cop asked neighbors in the area about a dog, and some said the pet — named Hiro — had lived with a family on the street for three years and was friendly.

The man who was seen on video telling the officer about the dog said he was ""pretty scared"" that the dog was going to bite him.

Officer Rivera then went to a nearby home asking a woman who the dog belonged to and the neighbor said Hiro is owned by the home next door.

When the officer approached the driveway of the home where Hiro lived, the dog came sprinting down the driveway barking. The officer can be seen backing away and heard telling the dog to ""back up."" The cop continued to order the dog to back down as he pulled out his gun.

The body camera stops right before the officer fires his weapon, killing the animal. Police said the dog was aggressive and the officer felt threatened.

Hiro, a Labrador mix who was rescued from a kill shelter, was a very friendly dog, according to his adoptive family.

CARJACKING SUSPECT FATALLY WOUNDED AFTER FIRING AT DEPUTIES

An armed suspect who fired at Volusia County sheriff’s deputies was fatally wounded Thursday afternoon and a VCSO sergeant survived with a grazing gunshot wound to the head in a shooting that erupted near Interstate 4 after the suspect carjacked a woman at gunpoint in Deltona, led deputies on a pursuit to the DeLand area and appeared to be ready to carjack another innocent person.

The initial carjacking was reported around 2:21 p.m. at a home on the 2500 block of Ludlow Street in Deltona, where the victim said a man got in her truck, pointed a gun at her, demanded her keys and then took off in the vehicle. Deputies attempted to stop the stolen truck in Deltona, but the suspect continued fleeing erratically. At one point, the suspect swerved at a deputy who deployed stop sticks on the truck. As he fled, the suspect appeared to be waving a handgun out the driver’s side window.

After several stop stick hits, with all four tires appearing to be deflated, the truck slowed to a crawl and came to a stop on State Road 44 in front of the Volusia County Fairgrounds. The suspect got out of the truck with the gun still in his hand and ran in the direction of several motorists who were stopped on the road next to him. A deputy drove his unmarked SUV in the suspect’s direction, preventing him from reaching another potential carjacking victim, and the suspect ran the other direction and opened fire at several other responding deputies. Deputies returned fire, striking the suspect several times. Still armed with the handgun, the suspect went into the woods, where deputies ultimately took him into custody, brought him out and performed first aid before he was transported to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

The deceased is Phillip Thomas Marsh, 30 (DOB 12/7/1988), of Lake Helen. Marsh had been reported missing and suicidal earlier this week and at the time, it was noted he was known to act violently toward law enforcement and has made threats of “suicide by cop” and suicide by other means.

The sergeant who received the graze wound to the head is Sgt. Thomas Dane, 54, who has been a VCSO deputy for 30 years (hire date in July 1988). Footage from Sgt. Dane’s body-worn camera indicates he was shot soon after emerging from his vehicle. His hat was found lying on the road with an entry hole next to the “SHERIFF’S K-9 UNIT” logo on the front, and an exit hole a few inches above that. He was treated and released from Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach.

In total, five deputies fired at Marsh. The exact number of shots fired is unconfirmed at this time. It’s believed Marsh fired multiple times. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is conducting the official investigation into the shooting. Those who fired their weapons have been placed on administrative leave with pay, which is standard following a deputy-involved shooting.

Sheriff Mike Chitwood, who was one of several units involved in the pursuit and was on scene during the shooting itself, commended the tactics and coordination of all involved. “Everything that they did was to try to prevent what happened – knowing that this was probably what was going to happen,” Chitwood said, adding: “I know tonight when I go home, I’ll be saying a prayer thanking the good Lord that Sgt. Dane will be back to work real soon.”

fS6mhHae1oc,20190315,Oklahoma Man Shot by Police Mistaken for Missouri Escapee,"SALLISAW, Okla. (AP) - Authorities say a knife-wielding Oklahoma man who was fatally shot by police had been reported as a possible Missouri jail escape.

Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Brook Arbeitman says 27-year-old Shawn Taylor Watie of Stilwell was shot by two officers in Sallisaw Thursday when he ""came after"" them with a knife. He died at a hospital.

Watie's brother-in-law, Jerod Neal, told KFSM-TV that Watie was walking to work when he was shot. Neal said he doesn't believe the police account because Watie was not combative.

Arbeitman says police found Watie while investigating reports of a man thought to be 30-year-old Travis Lee Davis, who escaped Sunday from a jail in Sedalia, Missouri. Davis was last seen Wednesday after authorities say he stole a police car while handcuffed in Heavener, Oklahoma, then disappeared after crashing the vehicle.",Shawn Taylor Watie,4565,knife,Native American,"Police said they received a call around 9 a.m. reporting a suspicious person walking along the highway.

Pounds wrote, ""I'm so sorry you have to grow up without us."" It was a message to his young son, who he had with Williams. They were in court just last week because of a custody dispute.

KSP say the chase started when someone called 911 in Gallatin County. The caller said they saw a woman, later identified as Williams, in distress and being forced into a car by Pounds at a gas station. The caller said it appeared the woman was asking for help and that the vehicle sped off toward southbound I-71.

KSP found the vehicle and tried to pull Pounds over, but he fled. The chase went on for at least 20 minutes until Pounds crashed the car on an exit ramp in Oldham County. KSP said while trying to apprehend Pounds, a trooper heard a gunshot coming from within the car, which he perceived as a deadly threat to himself and Williams.

The trooper fired at Pounds, striking and killing him. Williams was struck by at least one round of gunfire. She was taken to a hospital in Louisville where she was pronounced dead.

No one else was hurt. KSP is currently investigating the shootings. KSP said they may hold a news conference on the shootings Wednesday.",Ty'rell Pounds,4457,gun,Black,"Skylar Williams, a 20-year-old student taken from a branch campus of Ohio State University and her suspected abductor, Ty'rell Pounds, 24, were killed after a police chase ended.

The family of the man who was fatally shot is accusing a group of six California police officers of acting as ""judge, jury and executioner.""

Family identified the man as Willie McCoy, 20, a local rapper known as Willie Bo, The Guardian reported, and the San Francisco Chronicle reported the family has hired an attorney to investigate whether police were justified in the use of deadly force.

Six officers fired ""multiple rounds"" out of ""fear for their own safety"" after McCoy allegedly reached for a handgun after waking up Saturday night, the Vallejo Police Department said in a statement.

“There was no attempt to try to work out a peaceful solution,” Marc McCoy, Willie’s older brother, told The Guardian. “The police’s job is to arrest people who are breaking the law – not take the law into your own hands. You’re not judge, jury and executioner.""
